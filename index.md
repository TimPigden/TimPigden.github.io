# Blog about Scala and Related Projects

The aim of this blog is to add descriptions and worked examples of usage of various libraries that I and my Optrak colleagues work with in the day job.
Essentially I'm writing up my own exploratory tests. I hope it's of use to you!

I will attempt to keep the source code (though not necessarily the blogs) up-to-date. Please let me know with an issue on my github if it gets too far
out of step.
